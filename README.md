Thank you so much for the opprotunity to work on the Hahn Application, The learning was excellent and hope to full fill the requirements

Please download the project as a Zip and extract all files

(Kindly do a restore nuget packages if required)

If you had used the Vs 2019 as I had used for this IDE kindly if you have three solutions and start to build the application

On successful build, do a Ctrl+f5 to run the application, and pls check if the application is running in https://localhost:44348/swagger/index.html
